                           VERSIONS
       Plex86 versions & features list (past/present/future).


v0_1: Release Date July 7, 2003.

  hosts=Linux 2.4.20, FreeBSD(no TUN/TAP)
  guests=Linux 2.4.20, (Linux 2.5.59: need to recompile plex86)

  Notes:

  o Networking uses the TUN/TAP interface to attach the guest
    to the host network.  Thus network packets travel a long way
    from the guest to the recipient host user process (like the
    X server).  A one-way trip would look like:

      guest -> VM monitor -> host-kernel -> host-user -> (TUN/TAP) ->
      host-kernel -> X server.

    Ultimately, packets should be shuttled to/from the host kernel
    networking subsystem.  But TUN/TAP is a great interface at this
    stage of development.

  o The FreeBSD port doesn't use TUN/TAP, and can only boot the
    Linux kernel.  There's no place to send network packets to yet.

  o Compiler warnings were moved to embedded comments with the
    tag "fixme" in them.

  o Lots of rough stuff and many optimizations possible.

  o No floating point support yet.  Guest Linux kernel must be compiled
    with floating point emulation enabled.

  o Amount of (host) page pinning (non pageable) is fixed to 4 Megs for now.
    This should be settable and allow for many more pages to be pinned.
