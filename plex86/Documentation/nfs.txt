Booting/using NFS.

Iain McFarlane assembled the necessary initrd image to do an NFS
root mount.  For reference, here is his plex86 related URL
(http://imcfarla.homelinux.net/plex.html), though files have been
copied to the plex86 site.  An option passed to the Linux
kernel tells Linux which directory to NFS mount as the root directory,
so no modifications are necessary to the initrd image.

Paul Menage put together a minimal RedHat 7.3 filesystem (130 RPMs,
about 190MB total filesystem size) which you can boot/use.  You can
ssh into the guest Linux from your host machine.  To use it, you
will need the 2.4.20 Linux kernel compiled for plex86, a small
initrd image which loads the guest HAL network driver and knows
how to mount a root NFS filesystem thereafter, and of course the
NFS tarball of the RH7.3 filesystem.

Get all three of these files from the plex86 site:

  (1) From the http://sourceforge.net/projects/plex86/ page, get
  "RedHat 7.3 NFS root image" (rh73fs.tgz).

  (2/3) From the http://plex86.sourceforge.net/downloads.html page, get
  "Linux 2.4.20 image" (vmlinux-2.4.20-plex86.img), and
  "Linux 2.4.20 NFS initrd" (initrd.2M.nfs).

To use boot the NFS root, I am assuming you know how to export an NFS
directory properly and have NFS serving established on your host.  Some
basic steps follow.

* You need to extract the root directory to the place where you will
  export it on your host (server).  

* Add the exported directory to /etc/exports.  For example:

  /export/nfsroot 192.168.10.2(rw,no_root_squash)

* Tell NFS about the new addition to /etc/exports.

* For convenience, make/edit a script to start plex86 with the options
  for the linux kernel image, initrd image, and kernel options line to
  mount the NFS directory.  You can use host-user/doit-nfs as a reference.

* Load the plex86 kernel driver (see 'Documentation/quickie.txt').

* Start the plex86 user program.  For example, I do:

  cd host-user
  . doit-nfs

* Enter ifconfig and arp commands as root in another shell
  (see 'Documentation/quickie.txt').

* Type 'Enter' at the user program prompt.

* Watch the kernel boot.  When it is finished booting, it should display
  something like:

  "INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel"

* At this point, you can SSH into the guest from the host.  The password
  for root is 'plex86'.

  ssh -l root guest-vmnet

* When you are finished, execute the shutdown command with the '-f' option
  (from the guest root command line) to skip fsck on the next boot.

  shutdown -f -h -now

* Quit the plex86 user program.

Notes from Paul Menage regarding the RedHat 7.3 filesystem:

"In order to boot, I had to chmod -x /sbin/hwclock, otherwise plex86
bombed out due to IOPL being non-zero; apart from that, everything went
pretty smoothly."
